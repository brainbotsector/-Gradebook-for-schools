Gradebook consists of Class 7 students pf school
I have created my own dataset in which unique id for student is their roll
no.
By carefully observing the attributes,the appropriate visualization has been
performed.
For Grade of students they have 5 subjects
Goal is to remove the percentage of each students and give them grades
according to their scores
